"""Z₂ ordering on a Rydberg ring — builder + correlator observable.

Reproduces the protocol of

    A. Keesling et al., "Quantum Kibble-Zurek mechanism and critical dynamics
    on a programmable Rydberg simulator", Nature 568, 207 (2019).

A linear detuning ramp of duration τ drives the array across the transition into
the Z₂ (period-2) density wave. The correlation length ξ extracted from the
connected density-density correlator

    G(r) = (1/N) Σ_i [ ⟨n_i n_{i+r}⟩ - ⟨n_i⟩⟨n_{i+r}⟩ ],   indices mod N

grows with τ; its scaling is the Kibble-Zurek signature. `compute_observable`
returns that ξ, in lattice sites.

**The register is a ring, not a chain.** With periodic boundaries every atom has
the same two neighbours, so G(r) is a clean average over N equivalent pairs. On
an open chain the ends order differently from the bulk and that bias grows
exactly where ξ is largest — the regime the experiment is about.

`omega_offset` and `delta_offset` are the calibration hooks: qpu-submit measures
them on hardware and passes them in, noise-emulate replays the same values so
the emulation matches what the QPU actually ran.
